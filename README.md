# Personalized-PageRank-Algorithms-on-Neo4j
* Author: Xiaozhou Liang
## Introduction
As part of my senior design, this is the implementation of two advanced Personalized PageRank (PPR) algorithms, FORA and All-Pair-Backward-Search, on Neo4j Graph Database. For more details, please refer to "Dissertation.pdf", which is my graduation dissertation corresponding to this senior design.

## Dataset
For demo purpose, I use the "Game of Thrones" dataset. Directory "target/got.db" stores the Neo4j database files. And directory "dataset/got" stores the relationship and node files in csv format.
